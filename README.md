# ðŸ”§ Chai aur Deploy Backend
A backend practice repository focused on deploying Node.js + Express APIs with proper production practices.

## ðŸš€ What I Practiced
- Express server setup from scratch

- Environment variables with .env

- Nodemon for dev, npm start for production

- Deployment-ready folder and script structure

- First-time deployment using platforms like Render or Railway

### Use Case
- This repo is part of my learning journey toward understanding how backend services are deployed and configured in real-world environments.
