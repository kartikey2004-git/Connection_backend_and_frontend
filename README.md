# Connection Backend and Frontend

This repo is a practice ground for connecting a backend (Node/Express) with a React frontend.

## ðŸ¤¹ Whatâ€™s Inside
- Localhost-based communication between frontend and backend

- Understanding CORS and JSON communication

- Building simple fullstack workflows (React â†’ Express â†’ DB)

- Handling POST/GET routes with Axios from the frontend


### ðŸ§  Why This Repo Exists

- To learn how to bridge the gap between frontend and backend. This is where I figured out how data flows in real web apps.
